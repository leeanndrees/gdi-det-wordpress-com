       ##What is WordPress?

      <section data-markdown>
        ###All that to say...

        WordPress is a tool that lets you get your content &amp; ideas published on the web, fast, with a minimal budget â€“ or no budget at all.
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        ##Welcome to WordPress.com!

        Let's get settled in &amp; take a look at our settings.
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Settings

        We're starting at the bottom (cue Drake).

        ![Settings menu item](images/settings.png)
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Settings &gt; General

        - Change your title
        - Choose your tagline
          - a good one will include keywords and help your search engine rankings!
        - Check your timezone
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Settings &gt; Writing

        - Set your default category
          - you'll only have "Uncategorized" for now, but you can choose others later!
        - Set your default post format
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Settings &gt; Discussion

        - Choose whether and how people can comment on your writing
        - You can moderate comments as strictly as you wish
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Settings &gt; Google Analytics

        - Only for premium plans!
        - Google Analytics helps you track your site's visitors
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Settings &gt; Import

        Adding content you've published elsewhere is no problem!

        (Yes, even if it's not WordPress. Click "Other Importers" and see.)
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Other "Configure" Stuff

        Let's take a quick look at:

        - Sharing
        - People
        - Domains
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ##Let's Write Our First Post!

        ![add a post](images/add_post.png)
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ####Give your post:

        - A title
        - A few paragraphs of content 

      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ####Let's add:

        - An image
        - A link
        - Some **bold** &amp; _italicized_ text
        - Some headings
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        Your editor has two modes: visual &amp; HTML

        ![visual vs html](images/editortoggle.png)

        **Visual editor**: what you see is (mostly) what you get.

        **HTML editor**: makes code nerds happy!
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        I don't recommend using the post editor to change your text color, even though you can.

        Any guesses as to why not?
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        How can I change the date &amp; time of my post's publication?

        (WordPress is a little bit like a time machine!)
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ##Before We Publish: Post Options

        ![post options](images/post_options.png)
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Categories &amp; Tags

        Categories &amp; Tags help you sort your blog's content.

        **Categories** are for higher level sorting. 

        - Use 1 or 2 per post
        - Have few total categories for your site
        - Categories are usually capitalized, though it's a matter of preference
        - Think of them like chapters in a book's table of contents
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Categories &amp; Tags
        **Tags** can help link all related posts to each other.
        
        - Use as many as you need per post
        - Tags are often lowercased, though again it's up to you!
        - Think of them like index entries 
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
       ###Categories &amp; Tags

       An example:

       - **Post title**: Chocolate Chip &amp; Coconut Cookies
       - **Categories**: Dessert, Recipes
       - **Tags**: chocolate, coconut, cookies, holiday favorites
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Featured Image

        <blockquote>A featured image represent the contents, mood, or theme of a post or page.  Posts and pages can have a single featured image, which many themes and tools can use to enhance the presentation of your site.</blockquote>
        <small>From <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/featured-images/">WordPress Support</a></small>
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Sharing

        ...is caring

        ![guinea pigs sharing](images/guineapigs.jpg)
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Post Format

        Your theme may or may not display content differently based on this choice.

        [Guide to WordPress post formats.](https://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/post-formats/)
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###More Options &gt; Slug

        <ul>
          <li>The URL fragment that will refer to this post</li>
          <li>Example: myfoodblog.wordpress.com/<span class="pink">chocolate-chip-coconut-cookies</span></li>
          <li>WordPress generates one and usually it's fine, but you may want to make it shorter or more relevant</li>
          <li>No capitalization or spaces â€“ use hyphens instead</li>
          <li>Use keywords here to help your SEO!</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###More Options &gt; Excerpt

        - Some themes may display an excerpt on your home page
        - WordPress usually generates one, but you can set a custom one here
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ##Ok can we publish now?

        - Preview first!
        - Then go for it :)
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ##Let's Add a Page

        Spoiler alert: It's almost exactly like adding a post!
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Page Hierarchy

        Pages can be hierarchical, if you set a "Parent Page."

        Think of your site like an outline:

        - Home
        - About
          - Our Team
          - Our History
        - Contact

        "About" is the _parent page_ to "Our Team" and "Our History."
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ##Posts vs. Pages
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        **Pages** are best for static, timeless material you want your users to always be able to find easily. They can serve as a backbone for your site.
        <small>Examples: About, Contact, Location, Mission</small>

        **Posts** are best for time-sensitive updates and creating conversation. If you're running a blog, most of your content will be in the form of posts! 
        <small>Examples: This Month's Workshops, Springtime Recipes, We're in the Newspaper</small>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ##Menus

        How do we get to all those pages?

        ![menus](images/menus.png)
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Menus
        - Your theme controls how many menu areas you have
        - Common menu areas:
          - header
          - sidebar
          - footer
        - Social links menus will convert your Twitter, Facebook, etc. links into nifty icons!
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ##Themes

        ![themes](images/themes.png)
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###What is a theme?

        - Themes control the appearance of your site, but they don't alter the content at all
        - Try changing your theme and see what happens!
        - Click "Try and Customize" to make sure you like it first.
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Choosing the Best Theme

        - There are tons out there and it can be overwhelming!
        - What kind of content are you planning to show? Does this theme have all the areas you need to display images, text, sidebars, etc.?
        - Is it responsive?
        - Is it fast?
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ##WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org

        Yes, they're different things!
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        We've been using WordPress.com to create a blog that is hosted and managed by WordPress.com.

        ------

        Another option is to purchase your own hosting and install the WordPress software (available from _wordpress.org_) on a site you own and manage. 

        These sites are called **self-hosted WordPress sites**.
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Which one is best for you?

        It depends what you want to do!

        In short, WordPress.com is easier but gives you less control. With a self-hosted site, you have more power and more responsibility.
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Which one is best for you?

        WordPress.com is like renting an apartment; self-hosted sites are like buying a house.

        Let's look at [this comparison from Skillcrush](http://skillcrush.com/2014/06/05/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org/).

        <small>(If you're curious about self-hosted sites, look out for our **Intro to WordPress** workshop.)</small>
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ###Good news: you can always move!

        Remember the handy import/export tool? It'll help you move your content from WordPress.com to a self-hosted site, or vice versa, if your needs change!
